    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <p>This is a website I created for the CSUF Club Golf team. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes information about the club, upcoming events, pictures, and a contact form.</p>
    <h3>Project Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive design for mobile and desktop</li>
      <li>Contact form that sends an email to the club president</li>
      <li>Gallery of pictures from past events</li>
      <li>Information about the club and upcoming events</li>
      <li>Links to social media accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Languages Used:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Problems Faced:</h3>
    <p>One of the main challenges I faced was teaching myself JavaScript and CSS. I had prior experience building simple websites, but it was very basic. However, with a few YouTube videos I was able to make the website look nicer.
        I also had to teach myself the process of deploying the website. From buying the domain to hosting the website, I had to learn how to do everything.
